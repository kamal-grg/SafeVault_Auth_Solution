During the development of SafeVault's authentication system, several key security vulnerabilities were discovered and addressed. Passwords were initially stored in plaintext, making the system highly vulnerable to breaches. This was corrected by the addition of the BCrypt.Net library to securely hash and verify passwords. Potential SQL injection vulnerabilities were also discovered during user authentication. These were addressed by leveraging Entity Framework Core, which uses parameterized queries by default, thereby making injection attempts ineffective.

Role-based access control did not exist in the first instance, and all authenticated users could access sensitive functionality like the Admin Dashboard. This was addressed by adding session-based role checking to limit access to specific pages to users who had the "Admin" role alone.

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities were also considered, and automatic HTML encoding by Razor Pages provided protection out of the box. Throughout this process, GitHub Copilot was a great help by accelerating developmentâ€”suggesting secure code idioms, alerting to dangerous practices (like string concatenation in SQL), and suggesting the use of session and role checks for authorization. It even helped with writing unit tests for invalid logins and unauthorized use, making the system more robust. Overall, Copilot functioned as a useful pair programmer, making the system more secure and reducing debugging time significantly.
